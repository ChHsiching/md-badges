# ü§î FAQ


### Q: Why won't my badge lead anywhere?

<details>
<summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
<br>

By default, (mostly) all badges have (#) at the end of their code to define a link.

**You need to replace the (#) with a link that you'd like the badge to go to when clicked on.**

For example, if the code is:

`[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-%23121011.svg?logo=github&logoColor=white)](#)`


...you'll need to replace the (#) with a link (eg. https://github.com/inttter).

If the code is a dynamically updating badge such as this one:

 `[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/saadeghi/daisyui.svg)](https://github.com/badges/shields/releases)`

 <!-- daisyUI is used as an example - https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui !-->


You must replace 'saadeghi' with your GitHub username/organization, and 'daisyUI' with your repository name. This includes the redirect URL aswell.

**No**, you can also use them in HTML, by using `<a>` tags to link to a website, and `<img src>` tags to display the badge. 

Here's how you may format it if you were to link the badge to a website inside of a HTML file:

```html
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-%237F52FF.svg?logo=kotlin&logoColor=white" alt="Kotlin">
</a>
```

Result: <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-%237F52FF.svg?logo=kotlin&logoColor=white" alt="Kotlin">
</a>
